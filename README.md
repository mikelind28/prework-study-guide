# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This prework study guide is designed to store notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It was built as part of the introduction to a full-stack coding bootcamp. In building it, we learned the basics of HTML, how to apply styling to a webpage with CSS, how to add functionality to the webpage using JavaScript, and how to use Git version control to work on various features of a project without affecting the main branch.
